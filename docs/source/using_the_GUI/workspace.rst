===================================
Scaling and Workspace Manipulation
===================================
Use the standard plot tools (pane, zoom) to change the zoom-level of the main axis

Furthermore, you can use the slider on the bottom of the 'Scenario GUI' window in order to zoom further out.

.. hint:: The default scale, as well as the maximum scaling value can be adjusted via configuration parameters. For
    further details, check the corresponding documentation (:doc:`config`).
